# Fruit Classification using CNN

This repository contains code for a fruit classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to classify different types of fruits based on their images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of fruit images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding fruit type. The dataset should be organized into train and test sets.

## Requirements

- Python 
- TensorFlow 
- Keras 
- streamlit



## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

   - Ensure that the fruit images are stored in the appropriate directory structure.
   - Split the dataset into train and test sets.

2. Preprocess the data:

   - Resize the images to a consistent size.
   - Normalize the pixel values.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Train the CNN model:

   - Specify the architecture of the CNN model in `model.py`.
   - Set the hyperparameters and other configuration settings.
   - Run the training script:


4. Evaluate the model:

   - After training, the model will be saved.
   - Run the evaluation script to assess the model's performance:

5. Make predictions:

   - Use the trained model to classify new, unseen fruit images.
   - Preprocess the new images in the same way as the training images.
   - Run the prediction script:


6. Experiment and improve:

   - Feel free to modify the CNN architecture, hyperparameters, or preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance.
   - You can also try techniques like data augmentation or fine-tuning to enhance the model's accuracy.
